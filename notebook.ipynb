      "Answer: The book excerpt you provided is from the German Family Law section of the Federal Ministry of Justice. It outlines some of the legal aspects of marriage in Germany, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Marriage is for life:**  Section 1353 states that marriage is entered into for life, and spouses have a mutual duty of conjugal community.\n",
      "* **Family name:** Section 1355 states that spouses can choose a common family name, either the husband's or wife's birth name, or a different name altogether. If they don't choose, they keep their existing names.\n",
      "* **Engagement:** Section 1297 states that an engagement cannot be used as a basis for legal action, and promises to pay a penalty for not getting married are void.\n",
      "* **Withdrawal from engagement:** Section 1298 states that if an engaged person withdraws, they must reimburse the other person for any expenses incurred in anticipation of the marriage.\n",
      "* **Marriage registration:** Section 1310 states that marriage is only entered into if the parties declare their intention to marry before a registrar. The registrar cannot refuse to cooperate if the requirements are met, but must refuse if the marriage would be voidable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the book excerpt highlights the legal framework surrounding marriage in Germany, emphasizing the commitment to lifelong partnership and the importance of mutual responsibility between spouses. \n",
